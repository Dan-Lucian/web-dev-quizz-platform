            We are living in the Google era and it is fairly easy to find stuff
            online, but you cannot search for what you donâ€™t even remember.

            This is a platform that has access to a collection of questions
            about various web development related topics. For now this platform
            has questions about internet, html, css, javascript and react.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            The purpose of this platform is to remind developers about certain
            bits of information that they might forget. If during the tests you
            find yourself thinking - "Oh right, that's an actual thing.", then
            the planned purpose has been achieved!

                Each topic has a main topic (ex: javascript) and some respective
                subtopics (ex: functions).

              <li>
                In case you select a main topic (ex: javascript) the questions
                will be about the whole topic.

              <li>
                In case you select a subtopic (ex: objects) the questions will
                be only about that subtopic.
