            We are living in the Google era and it is fairly easy to find stuff
            online, but you cannot search for what you donâ€™t even remember.

            This is a platform that has access to a collection of questions
            about various web development related topics. For now this platform
            has questions about internet, html, css, javascript and react.
          </p>
          <br />
          <br />
          <p>
            The purpose of this platform is to remind developers about certain
            bits of information that they might forget. If during the tests you
            find yourself thinking - "Oh right, that's an actual thing.", then
            the planned purpose has been achieved!

            10 questions will be chosen at random based on the selected topics,
            then the chosen questions will be presented in a form of a test.

            <li style={{ marginBottom: '0.7em' }}>
              In case you select a main topic (ex: javascript) the questions
